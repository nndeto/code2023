AWS Compute
- Three services
    - Virtual Machines - Amazon EC2 --> disposable resources, great for proof of concept --> EC2 is unmanaged because we take care of fault tolerance, scaling, and availability; pay as you gopricing
    ECS - Elastic Container Service - rchestrates teh execution of containers; maintains and scales the fleet of nodes running your contiainers; removes the complexity of standing up the infrastructure 
        - mimics docker
    Serverless computing - building and running apps and services without managing servers (never pay for idle; scales with usage)

AWS Lamda - runs stateless code; can run code on a schedule or in response to events such as changes in data in an amazon bucket, etc

    - content storage and distribution
    - backup and archiving
